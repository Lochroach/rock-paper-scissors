This is my Rock Paper Scissors project! I will use this README.md file to plan out the project before I start coding

Understanding the problem:
    I need to create an app where the user can enter a value of either rock, paper, or scissors and the computer will enter the corresponding value and then presesnt the winner as the result. This will all be done in the console.

Pseudocode:
    1. create the computerPlayer function
    2. create the humanPlayer function
    3. create the 'you win/lose! something beats something!'
    4. create playRound function that will play the game
